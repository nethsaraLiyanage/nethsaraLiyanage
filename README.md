![I am Nethsara Liyanage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nethsaraLiyanage/nethsara/master/Nethsara%20Liyanage.png)

I am a hardworking and ambitious undergraduate, ready to learn from even the smallest experience I gain. While my passion lies in Computer Software and Hardware, Automobile, Photography and videography, I am determined to successfully face challenges that come in my way any day.
In developing I would like to work with React JS, Node JS, JAVA, SQL and NoSQL databases as well as the Android platform.

Skills: REACT / Node / JS / HTML / CSS / Bootstrap / SQL / NoSQL / Android / Flutter

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Sri Lanka Telecom Digital Lab
